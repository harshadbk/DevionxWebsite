  {
    title: "What are the best practices for writing clean code?",
    content: "Best practices include writing meaningful variable and function names, keeping functions short and focused, avoiding repetition (DRY principle), and properly documenting code.",
  },
  {
    title: "How can you ensure software scalability?",
    content: "Software scalability can be achieved by writing efficient code, using proper architecture patterns like microservices, and ensuring the infrastructure can handle increased load, such as through load balancing and database sharding.",
  },
  {
    title: "What tools are commonly used in software development?",
    content: "Common tools include Visual Studio Code, Git, Jira, Docker, Jenkins, GitHub, React, Angular, Node.js, and various testing frameworks like Jest and Mocha.",
